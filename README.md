LambdaLoungeCHA
===============

The Chattanooga fork of Lambda Lounge, a functional and dynamic languages interest group. The Lambda Lounge concept is a monthly user group organized loosely around the idea of exploring dynamic and functional languages.  More broadly, itâ€™s an open forum to examine new advances in programming languages and libraries (http://lambdalounge.org/2008/11/11/welcome/).
