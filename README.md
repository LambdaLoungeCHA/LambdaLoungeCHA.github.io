Lambda Lounge is on indefinite hiatus. If you want a fun alternative, try Papers We Love! https://github.com/papers-we-love/chattanooga

The Chattanooga fork of Lambda Lounge, a functional and dynamic languages interest group. The Lambda Lounge concept is a monthly user group organized loosely around the idea of exploring dynamic and functional languages.  More broadly, itâ€™s an open forum to examine new advances in programming languages and libraries (http://lambdalounge.org/2008/11/11/welcome/).

Meetings are the last Tuesday of the month at 6:30pm. RSVP via Meetup: http://www.meetup.com/Chattanooga-Lambda-Lounge
